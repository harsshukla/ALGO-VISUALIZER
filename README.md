## Introduction
Welcome to **BinarySearchVsLinearSearch**, an interactive web application designed to help users understand and compare the efficiency of Binary Search and Linear Search algorithms through visual representation.

## Features
- **Visualization**: See how each algorithm approaches the search process step by step.
- **Comparison**: Evaluate the performance of both algorithms based on the number of passes required to complete a search.
- **Asynchronous Waiting for better visualtization**: Experience seamless visualization and table updates without page reloads.

## How to Use
1. **Input Array**: Start by entering a list of numbers in the array.
2. **Search Value**: Input the number you wish to search for.
3. **Review**: Observe the visual cues and table updates to understand the algorithms' behavior.

## Comparison Table Explanation
The comparison table provides a side-by-side analysis of the number of passes each algorithm took to find the search value, allowing for a direct efficiency comparison.

## Visualization Details
The visualization section graphically displays the search process, highlighting the current element being compared and the number of elements left to search.

## Technical Aspects
This website utilizes an **asynchronous approach** to ensure that the visualization and table updates occur in real-time, providing an interactive learning experience.
